\section*{Abstract}
One of the main constraints for the widespread employment of Software Defined Networking (SDN) is the number of entries in that can be stored in a given switch's flow table. Despite numerous flow table compression schemes and algorithms, no common system for implementation and comparison of those schemes is currently widely available. This research internship provides the basics of a platform-agnostic, extensible system for exactly that purpose. Illustratively, various aggregation schemes are implemented and compared. The work here presented also includes the implementation of tools for rule aggregation for a popular SDN Controller, Project Floodlight.
